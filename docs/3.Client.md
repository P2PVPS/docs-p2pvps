# Overview #
This document contains the specifications for the Client software. The Client software is defined by the following
high-level features:

* Governor
* Docker container with SSH
* Persistent Storage
    * Encryption
* Deployment Packages (pre-configured scripts for setting up apps like webservers, file sharing, etc.)
* Testing

The sections below detail the specifications for each of these features:

## Governor-(p2p-vps-client.js)
The primary purpose of the governor software is to manage the Docker container and communicate with the
P2P VPS server. This application runs on the host operating system, outside the
Docker container. It plays the following roles:
* It reads the `device-config.json` file and registers the Client device with the P2P VPS server.
* It builds the Docker container with information returned by the server after registration.
* It launches the Docker container after being built.
* It sends a heartbeat signal to the P2P VPS server every 10 minutes. The server responds with an expiration date.
* When the expiration date is reached, the governor software stops the Docker container and wipes the flash drive.
It then reregisters itself with the P2P VPS marketplace.

## Docker-Container
A Docker container is generated by the `p2p-vps-client.js` governor application.
The Owner initiates the creation of the Docker container by registering the device
in the Device Management Dashboard. They are given a GUID, which they
then copy to the file `device-config.json`. `p2p-vps-client.js` reads this file
and makes a REST API call to the server to register itself.

After a successful registration call, the server returns a computer generated
username, password, and port.
The port is used to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to the Docker container. The
username and password are used to create a user account for the Docker container.
This information is passed to the Renter when they purchase the rental contract
in the OpenBazaar application.

When the contract is terminated, the Docker container is destroyed and all
persistent data wiped.
A new Docker container with new login credentials is generated for the next renter,
and a new listing is added to the P2P VPS OpenBazaar store.

## Persistent-Storage
Persistent storage can take many forms, but a USB flash drive will be encouraged,
as SD cards have shown reliability issues. Most IoT devices, like the Raspberry
Pi can boot off an SD card. Extra storage can
easily be accommodated through USB flash drives or even USB external hard drives.
64GB Flash drives will be a (rough) standard due to their availability and low prices.

The `flash-storage` client has been designed to automatically find, format, and mount
persistent storage.

### Encryption
Encryption managed by the Device Owner has been explored, but found ineffective.
It will be best to put the responsibility and encryption keys in the hands of the
Renter. Owners will be under no obligation to provide encrypted drives. However,
instructions for setting up LUKS encryption inside the renters Docker container
will be provided by this project.

* [This is an excellent guide](https://launchbylunch.com/posts/2014/Jan/13/encrypting-docker-on-digitalocean/)
that can be adapted to encrypt persistent storage in a Docker container.


## Deployment-Packages
A collection of scripts will be made available to renters. These are
preconfigured shell scripts or some other type of package manager that allows
them to quickly deploy common web services like NextCloud, a blog, a webserver,
a single page application development environment, a TOR node, an OpenBazaar
server, VPN software, etc. Easy scripts to deploy many of
[these use cases](https://raspberry-hosting.com/en/applications).

This project will rely on user contributions or 'corporate sponsorships' for this
section. If interested, please see our [Contributing README](y.Contributing.md)
or [contact us](http://p2pvps.org/contact-us/).

## Testing
Unit testing is initially planning to use Mocha, but we could use any platform
at this stage. We could really use help with getting a solid unit testing library
in place for Client software. [Contact us](http://p2pvps.org/contact-us/) if you'd
like to help with this effort.
