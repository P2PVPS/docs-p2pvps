# Server Specification Overview
This document contains the specifications for the **Server** software. The Server
software is split into two domains: the *front end* and *back end*.

**The front end** of the server has to do will all the activity that takes place
in a web browser. It's primarily concerned with the Vue.js application that allows
renters and owners to manage devices. It is composed of the following high-level
features:

* Rental Search - searching and filtering rental devices.
* Device Management Dashboard - allowing device owners to manage their devices on the network.

**The back end** of the server is primarily concerned with the database and REST APIs
used to coordinate the different pieces of software in the P2P VPS suite.
It is composed of the following high level features:

* Database
* REST API
* OpenBazaar Store
* Port Control

The sections below detail the specifications for each of these features:


## Rental-Search-UI
The _Rental Listing_ view allows users to quickly search and sort for devices
on the network that meet their criteria. Text search will be available, as well
as filtering and sorting by metrics such as price, uptime, memory, diskspace, and
geographic location. These metrics will be automatically validated by software
running on the device whenever possible.

* Controls will be implemented to allow the user to search through listings by metrics
such as price, ratings, memory size, disk space, internet connection speed, etc.

* When a desired listing is found, the user will be able to click on a link that
takes them to the listing in their local OpenBazaar (OB) application, where they can
make a purchase. If their computer can not do this automatically, a link will be
provided to a page with directions to access the OB listing manually.

## Device-Management-Dashboard-UI
The _Owned Devices_ view allows device owners to manage
the devices subscribed to the P2P VPS server. It's primary features are:

* An input form can be accessed to register new devices with the server. This
generates the GUID needed to register a client device with the server.

* A standardized component is placed within the page for each device registered with the
server. The element displays the connection status (and other information) of each device.

Here is a mockup of the current dashboard. This will be heavily modified in the future:

# Back End

## Database
[MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB) is the database used by the
P2P VPS server.

Each device registered into the marketplace gets two database models,
called `devicePublicModel` and `devicePrivateModel`.
Most data about a device is assumed to be public. Specifically, private things
like the SSH port, username, password, and user account of the renter is kept
in the private DB model. Security checks are done to ensure only admins,
device owners, or active device renters can access the private model.

* Updating data in the database should only be done through REST API calls.
Complex database models and complex manipulation of those models tends to lead
to bugs. Keeping functions small, modular, and testible via REST API calls prevents
hard-to-find bugs.

## REST-API
The P2P VPS server is based off this
[Koa Boilerplate](https://github.com/christroutner/babel-free-koa2-api-boilerplate)
for creating a REST API server.

* REST-ful APIs for this server include the following basic CRUD commands.
All API calls outside this standard will be listed separately.
    * *GET* `/api/<collection>` - list all items in the collection.
    * *POST* `/api/<collection>` - create a new item in the collection.
    * *GET* `/api/<collection>/:id` - get a single item from the collection
    based on its GUID.
    * *PUT* `/api/<collection>/:id` - update a specific item in the database.
    * *DELETE* `/api/<collection>/:id` - remove a specific item from the database.

* [Separate API documentation](https://p2pvps.net/docs/)
is generated using [apidocs](http://apidocjs.com/)
based on comments in the server code.


## OpenBazaar-Store
Each P2P VPS server is also an [OpenBazaar](http://openbazaar.org) (**OB**) store.
OB will be leveraged to handle the
transactions between Device Owners and Renters. When a Device Owner submits
their device to
the P2P VPS Marketplace, the Server will be responsible for generating a contract
on the OpenBazaar network. Renters then purchase the contract using their own
OpenBazaar application. Login and password for the rented device is passed to them
through the 'Fulfilled' stage of the ordering process.

The OpenBazaar store is contained in it's own Docker container. It uses the
[latest Dockerhub image](https://hub.docker.com/r/openbazaar/server/tags/) of
the [openbazaar-go server](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go).

OB contracts are managed using the `obContract` database model. This model has the following properties:

* `id` - The unique MongoDB UUID for each record.
* `ListingUri` - The OB URI need to retrieve the specific listing in the OB client
* `Price` - The price in USD
* `Expiration` - When the contract will expire if not purchased.
* `Title` - Title used in the listing
* `Description` - Description used in the listing
* `imageHash` - An IPFS hash link to an image on the OB network.
* `Owner` - The GUID of the device owner. This is a MongoDB relationship.
* `Renter` - The GUID of the device renter. This is a MongoDB relationship.
* `listingState` - The state of the listing. This is a string with these following possible states:
    * `not-listed` - (default) not listed on the OB marketplace
    * `listed` - listed on the OB marketplace
    * `sold` - off the market, login into sent to the renter
    * `released` - off the market, device needs reset and relisting.
    * `expired` - the listing has expired on the OB market and needs to be relisted.


## Port-Control
This is a Database API that is used to manage a list of available SSH ports for
making reverse SSH tunnel connections between the Server and Client devices.

* *POST* `/api/sshport` - Request a new SSH port and generate a
random username and password for the client.

* *DELETE* `/api/sshport/:id` - Release a port.

## Testing
Testing of the server code will be different from the standpoint *front end* and
*back end*.

Testing of **front end** code will use the same test-suite provided by the
[vue-template/webpack repository](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack).
Namely, Mocha will be used for unit tests
and Karma will be used for end-to-end testing. We badly need a contributor to
help us setup and maintain a suite of testing scripts and set up Continuous
Integration testing.

Testing of the **back end** also uses Mocha as the test-runner and Chai as
the assertion engine. Travis CI is the continuous integration service and
Coveralls is the test coverage reporting service.
