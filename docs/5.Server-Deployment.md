# Server Deployment
The server deployment software is a collection of Dockerized packages, all orchestrated
with Docker Compose. This software is targeted for cloud VPS hosts like Digital Ocean, Vultr,
AWS EC2, etc running Ubuntu Linux. The purpose of using Docker is to make deployment
of P2P VPS servers as easy as possible. With a handful of commands, new servers
join the market quickly and easily.

Below is a diagram of the Server Deployment software stack. Internet traffic is
first routed by [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) to the appropriate Docker container.
Nginx also handles SSL encryption using a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
certificate. All of the Docker containers ride on top of the underlying Linux
host operating system.

The various Docker containers are networked and orchestrated using a Docker Compose
`.yml` file. Each container writes to it's own debug logs which are stored in the
hidden `.p2pvps` folder in the users home directory.
