# Server Deployment
The server deployment software is a collection of Dockerized packages, all orchestrated
with Docker Compose. This software is targeted for cloud VPS hosts like Digital Ocean, Vultr,
AWS EC2, etc running Ubuntu Linux. The purpose of using Docker is to make deployment
of P2P VPS servers as easy as possible. With a handful of commands, new servers
join the market quickly and easily.

Below is a diagram of the Server Deployment software stack. Internet traffic is
first routed by [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) to the appropriate Docker container.
Nginx also handles SSL encryption using a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
certificate. All of the Docker containers ride on top of the underlying Linux
host operating system.

The various Docker containers are networked and orchestrated using a Docker Compose
`.yml` file. Each container writes to it's own debug logs which are stored in the
hidden `.p2pvps` folder in the users home directory.

## Koa-API
This is the [P2P VPS Server](https://github.com/P2PVPS/p2pvps-server2) REST API
described in the Server chapter. All other containers support
this primary container.

## MongoDB
P2P VPS uses the standard [MongoDB Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/)
hosted on Docker Hub.

## Listing-Manager
The listing manager automates the maintenance of OpenBazaar listings that would
otherwise require a human. The
role of the Listing Manager can be understood best by this workflow illustration:

## OpenBazaar
The OpenBazaar store is contained in it's own Docker container. It uses the
[latest Dockerhub image](https://hub.docker.com/r/openbazaar/server/tags/) of
the [openbazaar-go server](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go). The
server communicates with the store via the
[OpenBazaar REST API](http://api.openbazaar.org), using the
[openbazaar-node](https://github.com/P2PVPS/openbazaar-node) library.

## SSH-Server
The SSH tunnel server will run inside its own Docker container. It is necessary
to give user-level shell access in order to generate the reverse tunnel to the
client devices. Keeping the SSH server isolated to it's own Docker container
reduces the threat of giving out shell access.

**It may be possible to allow reverse SSH connections without granting shell
access to the server. Exploring this option needs to be a high priority.**
[See this GitHub issue](https://github.com/P2PVPS/server-deployment2/issues/1).

## LocalTunnel
The LocalTunnel server is also responsible for establishing a subdomain
(like **abc**.p2pvps.com) and proxying connections from port 80 (HTTP) or port
442 (HTTPS) to the rented device. The easiest way to do this is by leveraging
a [LocalTunnel Server](https://github.com/localtunnel/server).

While the project is still in its infancy, we can use the
[localtunnel.me](http://localtunnel.me) server, but
we'll eventually need to set up our own server. The LocalTunnel server software
expects to have the server to itself, without any competition for ports.
Putting it inside a Docker container has proven problematic.
